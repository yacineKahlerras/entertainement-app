## Overview

using the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3) to get the list of different movies and shows,
the app organize them into different category sections where you can hit "see more" to go to the category
page where you can select the movie/show category that you like and also search for the movie/show that you want to find.
also in the navigation there is a movies only and tv shows only page.

### What I Learned

- i gained a better undersanding of how to handle api's because they do not always show the same informations
  or be non-existant or have them in as something different, also reading the documentations and finding
  all the cool ways that i can do with the api is really fun
- giving the client feedback on what it going on when loading instead of appearing freezed.
- lazy load images to inhance performance and smoothness of the app
